## AI Use Summary

**Tools Used:**

- ChatGPT-5 mini
- Gemini 2.5 Flash
- Claude Sonnet 4.5
- Claude Haiku
- Deepseek R1
- Github Copilot

**Prohibited Phases Avoided:**

- Requirements elicitation
- Architecture/design decisions
- Decision rationales

**Allowed Uses:**

- Implementation code writing based on requirements
- Boilerplate generation based on provided requirements
- Debugging
- Writing tests based on cases and behavior provided
- Refactoring and modification for readability

**Verification (Author Reviews):**

- Verified correctness of the modifications by AI against requirements
- Validated correctness and simplicity, and fixed small implementation issues
- Validated behavior by running tests where relevant, clarified confusing parts, and fixed small implementation issues
- Validated correctness by running tests where applicable, clarified ambiguous code, and fixed minor implementation issues
- Checked correctness, tested and clarified intent in code comments
- Verified behavior and ran tests, clarified the code, and fixed small implementation issues
- Validated correctness against the team's requirements, ran tests, then improved clarity and debugged interactions with other components
- Checked correctness, executed tests, and refined unclear implementations while debugging minor issues
- Resolved small issues, debugged UI interactions, and verified changes locally
- Fixed minor issues, improved clarity, and ran checks to confirm the UI works as expected
- Changed behaviour of a couple of test cases for clarity
- Improved clarity in a few places and validated the updated components function correctly
- Debugged UI styling and confirmed the components render correctly
- Fixed minor problems and tested the UI interactions to ensure they behave correctly
- Cleaned up small messy implementations and ran quick checks to validate behavior
- Cleaned up small issues and ran basic checks to confirm behavior
- Cleaned up a few utilities and validated they still behave as expected
- Fixed small untidy implementations, debugged the UI, and resolved minor test failures

**Concise Usage Summaries (Scopes):**

- Reviewed the code and identified a few potential bugs, then suggested small fixes
- Helped debug issues discovered during testing, then updated the code to fix them
- Suggested tests covering edge cases highlighted by the user
- Refactored code to reduce clutter and added a few explanatory comments
- Reviewed the code structure and caught a few minor issues, then suggested small improvements
- Reviewed the code, found potential small bugs, and suggested small fixes to avoid runtime issues
- Refactored parts to reduce clutter and added clarifying comments
- Reviewed utility code, caught small issues, and suggested tidy-ups
- Helped implement several functions and clarifying comments
- Helped debug issues reported during testing, corrected small faults, and made minor refactors to improve clarity and robustness
- Helped implement several functions according to the team's requirements and provided focused code cleanups and clarifying comments
- Refactored small sections for clarity and added inline comments to simplify maintenance and readability
- Assisted with debugging using the user's test findings, fixed code to work correctly, and tidied up sections with small refactors; also suggested tests for relevant edge cases
- Generated boilerplate for files in this service from the team's requirements and guidance; refactored small sections and added clarifying comments; suggested tests for edge-cases based on user-specified scenarios
- Helped implement several functions to meet the team's requirements and simplified code through targeted refactoring and added clarifying comments; suggested tests for a few edge cases
- Assisted implementing several collaborative editor features and refactored minor parts for clarity
- Assisted implementing parts of the table display logic and caught a few small issues
- Generated mock data for testing based on sample requirements provided by the user
- Assisted implementing small header display logic and ensured layout consistency
- Assisted implementing chat panel UI interactions, adding a few small refinements for readability
- Assisted implementing chat data fetching and message helpers, and clarified a few code comments
- Assisted implementing parts of the language selection and run button UI and tidied a few helper paths for readability
- Assisted implementing several collaborative editor display helpers and refactored small parts for clarity
